## Battleground
#### A website that hosts battles. 

_I *doubt* this will be a good idea, but I figured with the lack of
such a thing, I think I'd at least have some fun with friends or w/e_

Basically, I think a web site that has "sub-communities" known as
"sub-battlegrounds," in which users generate their own _challenges_
would appeal to certain competitive communities. Randomly queuing
with someone close in *ELO* or (however a sub-battleground quantifies
skill) to compete against each other can form an awesome studying
tool that makes learning fun. 

I have a few examples:

* Imagine a Math sub-battleground where you compete with someone else
in arithmetic. Let's say that sub-battleground writes their algorithms
to generate random x - y, x * y, stuff, etc...

* Rap battles and stuff

* Text editing challenges, maybe the quickest person who formats some
document correctly wins, ik Vim users are crazy about that stuff.

* Memory people can write a few battles that measure how many random
numbers you can memorize that flash quickly on the screen.

#### Problems:

- [ ] Doubt enough communities exist for this sort of thing.

- [ ] People who write their own "battles" would know the questions beforehand.

- [ ] How would the interface for the sub-battleground moderators be presented such
that they could manage their sub-battlegrounds, accept certain battles that are
submitted by a user, etc.

- [ ] Matchmaking, 1v1 or multiple? How would this be implemented for voice and/or audio

- [ ] Cheating.

_with the problems laid out, it's quite obvious that this is a bad idea, but I got nothing
else to do._
